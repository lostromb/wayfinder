        <description>Bond is an extensible framework for working with schematized data. It is suitable for scenarios ranging from service communications to Big Data storage and processing.

Bond defines a rich type system and schema versioning rules which allow forward and backward compatibility. The core Bond features include high performance de/serialization and service-oriented RPC. The framework is highly extensible via pluggable serialization protocols, network transports and more.

By design Bond is language and platform independent and is currently supported for C++, C#, Java, F# and Python. The core of C++ implementation is platform agnostic and compiles with Visual C++, Clang and GNU C++. The RPC framework and network transports are currently only implemented for Windows.</description>
